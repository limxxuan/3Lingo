## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

I was responsible for the design and testing processes related to **User 2 – Kids persona** across all tasks:
- **Task 1: Backup** – Designed a child-friendly flow for activating backup features and selecting data
- **Task 2: Learn New Vocabulary** – Focused on associative memory techniques using images to help kids retain new words
- **Task 3: Grammar Check** – Developed an engaging grammar correction experience tailored to young learners using interactive suggestions

My work involved task analysis, wireframe creation, and conducting usability testing for the Kids persona to ensure the design is accessible, fun, and easy to use.
